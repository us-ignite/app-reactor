      <h2>Smart Gigabit Community Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Key features separate communities ready to take the lead<br />
        in the emerging gigabit economy.  Ecosystems that provide services, attract<br />
        businesses, and enable growth have these features in common.

    <ul class="features">
      <li class="icon fa-forward">
        <h3>Gigabit Speeds</h3>
        <p>Ultra-Fast networks that exceed the limits of current broadband technologies enable sharing more information than ever before, at faster speeds, in all directions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-clock-o">
        <h3>Real-Time Responses</h3>
        <p>Services can recieve replies from systems on the edge of the community network with no perceptable delay, providing the same interactive as being there in person.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-code">
        <h3>Intelligent Networks</h3>
        <p>Software Defined Networks can adapt to changing conditions in real-time and intelligently route traffic to isolate critical infrastructure to the right members.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-exchange">
        <h3>Local Traffic Exchanges</h3>
        <p>Gigabit network traffic never leaves the region and local network providers exchange local traffic freely for the shortest routes and response times possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-heart-o">
        <h3>Innovation Incubator</h3>
        <p>Local developers connect and communicate freely with one another, they understand how to access local infrastructure to develop new ideas and have a way to incubate their applicaitons locally in edge-compute hosts.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-server">
        <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
        <p>Compute resources are integrated into the community infrastructure and available to innovators.  Local data-centers, community academic or government clusters, and compute capable embedded devices all allow smart applications to run at or near the point of interaction for ultra-fast response times.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
